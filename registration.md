## How to register

You can register for the conference at [this link to the registration/payment page](https://payments.uwa.edu.au/45AACRegistration).

> Currently, the payment system is not adding extra dinner and excursion tickets to the tally, so please only register (for the moment) if you are not requiring extra tickets.

## CMSA membership for one year

Your registration will automatically include a one-year membership of the [Combinatorial Mathematics Society of Australasia (CMSA)](http://combinatorics-australasia.org/), if you are not already a life member of the CMSA.

## Excursion

Details about the excursion will appear here. Provisionally, we plan to have two activities to choose from. More details to come.

## Extras

When you are paying the registration fee (via the link given above), you will also be able to order

- extra tickets to the conference dinner (AUD $100, including GST),
- tickets to the excursion (AUD $50, including GST).

**One conference dinner ticket is included with registration.**
