### About

ACC is the annual conference of the Combinatorial Mathematics Society of Australasia (CMSA). It covers all areas of combinatorics in mathematics and computer science. This conference was previously known as ACCMCC (Australasian Conference on Combinatorial Mathematics and Combinatorial Computing), and the name was changed to ACC from 2020 onwards following a recommendation of the CMSA. Past and future editions of ACCMCC/ACC can be found [here](http://combinatorics-australasia.org/conferences.html).
The 45th ACC will be hosted by [The University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au), Perth, Australia, 11-15 December 2023. It will be an in-person, face-to-face, conference.
