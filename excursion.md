> Our excursion is to **[Fremantle Prison](https://fremantleprison.com.au)**. We are joining the Convict Prison Tour at 14:15.
The coach leaves UWA Tennis Courts at 13:30 (near Hackett Drive) (add map). It will take us directly to the prison, so please get lunch first.

The convict tour promises the following:

> Discover the history of Fremantle Prison from its construction in the 1850s until the end of the convict era in 1886.
> Find out why almost 10,000 men were transported from Great Britain and Ireland, how they built their own prison and helped shape the future of Western Australia.
> Discover our history through their stories.


After the tour we encourage you to wander around Fremantle town - it has recently been described as the best example of an urban walkable city in Western Australia!
